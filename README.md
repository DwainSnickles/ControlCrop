# ControlCrop
Add Cropping to any control with image or backgroundimage
I love programing exspeccially in graphics. 
I ran into a situation where I need to crop a simple picturebox wasnt as easy as anticipated.
Then I wanted to crop a panel background image started rewritting the code for that.
Brainstorm how about a class that could be universal to any control that has some kind of image.

WALA This class was born.
